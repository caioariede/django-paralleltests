# django-paralleltests
A Test Runner for Django that runs tests in parallel.

The `--parallel` option for running tests was added in Django 1.9, described as follows:

> Each process gets its own database. You must ensure that different test cases donâ€™t access the same resources. For instance, test cases that touch the filesystem should create a temporary directory for their own use.

It's such a fantastic feature and well done, but what if you have a code base prior to Django 1.9?

## Backporting the `--parallel` option

It's not as easy because it doesn't depend only on building a new test runner or backporting some existing work.

Tests needs to be written knowing they are running in parallel and [they may collide with other tests](https://github.com/aaugustin/django/commit/bf2c969eb7d941812993d69bcf7c8ac35bdb7726).

To prevent this, we need isolation. Docker.

## Idea

Develop a test runner that will run tests in parallel inside an isolated environment (Docker), to avoid collisions.
